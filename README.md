The Tic-Tac-Toe robot is a robot that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a user. It succesfully builds, scans and plays on the board, while keeping track of high scores from the user and playing on different difficulty levels.

A few of the tasks this robot can complete are:

- Recieving input on difficulty level from the user and then drawing the tic-tac-toe board.
- Resetting to the default position (sensor/pen in bottom left closest to robot), and awaiting a move, signaled by the user by the touch sensor.
- Scanning the board using the colour sensor, and outputting to the user if they made an invalid play.
- Playing a spot based on difficulty level (easy will be random valid spot, medium will either pick the best move or random move, and hard mode will always make   the best move).
- Looping through moves, user vs robot until a terminal board condition is met (ie user or robot wins, or there is a tie).
- Ending the game, and displaying to the user the result, as well as the cumulative score (1 for winning on easy, 2 for winning on medium, 3 for winning on hard) and the option to play again. These scores will also be scored on a file that can be downloaded.
- If the user selects to end, exiting the code, if the user selects to play again, another board is created.
