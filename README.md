The Tic-Tac-Toe robot is a robot that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a user. It successfully builds, scans, and plays on the board while keeping track of high scores from the user and playing on different difficulty levels.

A few of the tasks this robot can complete are:

- Receiving input on the difficulty level from the user and then drawing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Resetting to the default position (sensor/pen in the bottom left closest to the robot) and awaiting a move, signaled by the user by the touch sensor.
- Scanning the board using the color sensor and outputting to the user if they made an invalid play.
- Playing a spot based on difficulty level (easy will be a random valid spot, medium will either pick the best move or a random move, and hard mode will always make the best move).
- Looping through moves, user vs. robot until a terminal board condition is met (i.e., user or robot wins, or there is a tie).
- Ending the game and displaying to the user the result, as well as the cumulative score (1 for winning on easy, 2 for winning on medium, 3 for winning on hard), and the option to play again. These scores will also be recorded in a file that can be downloaded.
- If the user selects to end, exiting the code; if the user selects to play again, another board is created.
